Branches: Current vs. New
A branch in GitHub is essentially a separate version of a repository where you can make changes without affecting the main codebase.

Your current branch is the one you’re working on at the moment.

A new branch is a fresh copy of the repository that starts from a specific point (usually the default branch), allowing you to work on new features or fixes separately.

Why Create a New Branch?
In best practices, if you're working on the default branch (usually called main or master), you should create a new branch for your changes instead of committing directly to main. This keeps the default branch clean and avoids breaking existing functionality.

Pull Request (PR) and Its Relevance
A Pull Request (PR) is GitHub’s way of proposing changes to a repository. Once you’ve made changes on a new branch, a PR allows you to:

Review and compare your changes against the default branch.

Let others review, comment, and approve before merging.

Keep collaboration smooth, ensuring quality control.

In short, the tutorial is guiding you toward a best practice—working on a new branch, making changes, and using a PR to integrate those changes safely.
